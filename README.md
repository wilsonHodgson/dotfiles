### Configuration and Installation

This configuration is assuming you have a computer capable of running 3D rendering software.
If your computer can't do that, only install using the "desktop", or "minimal" arguments.

example:
``` install.sh minimal```

**Remember to commit changes to your configuration to this repo!**


# TODO: create an install script from the configuration script that installs dependencies to the configurations
