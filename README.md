### Configuration and Installation

This configuration is assuming you have a computer capable of running 3D rendering software.
If your computer can't do that, only install using the "desktop", or "minimal" arguments.

example:
``` configure.sh minimal```

**Remember to commit changes to your configuration to this repo!**
